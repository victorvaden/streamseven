## What is it

A javascript app thing that aims to make it easy to search for and
compare correspondences across paths.

## How do you use it

On login, you're greeted with a blank workspace, the path indicies on
the left, and a search bar on top. Search for entries in the bar and
their respective column will be added to the workspace. You can also
search and add columns by their titles or roman numeral
designation. Entries you add will have their rows marked "active" -
you can tell since the text becomes bold. Click the eye, and focus
narrows to the active rows. Click it again, and the focus widens.

## Running into issues

If all the feedback you've got is "it doesn't work" then I'm going to
ignore it. If you do believe it's broken, file an issue with the
observed behavior, expected behavior, browser, OS, and any steps to
reproduce. If there's missing or incorrect information, file an issue.
